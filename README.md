#To-do list
WORK IN PROGRESS

If for some strange reason, you feel the need to use this, you'll need to have xpad installed on your computer.
just look it up in your package manager, it should be there somewhere.

After that just $ln Content-whatever (or whatever your xpad save file is called) to a copy of it in the diretory of the homepage. Jquery doesn't play nice with parent diretories.

I suppose you could use this with any other .txt based document, but that's your problem, not mine.
